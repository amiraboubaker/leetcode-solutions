# LeetCode Solutions in Python

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, implemented primarily in Python. Each problem is organized in its own folder with the solution code, tests, and a detailed README explaining the problem, approach, and examples.

## Repository Structure

- Each problem has its own directory (e.g., `961-n-repeated-element/`).
- Inside each directory:
  - `solution.py`: The main solution code.
  - `test.py`: Unit tests to verify the solution.
  - `README.md`: Problem description, examples, and constraints.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leetcode-solutions.git
   cd leetcode-solutions
   ```

2. Navigate to a specific problem folder and run the tests:
   ```
   cd 961-n-repeated-element
   python test.py
   ```
